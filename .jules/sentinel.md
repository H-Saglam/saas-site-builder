**Vulnerability:** Unrestricted file download via `fetch` allowing SSRF. The code only checked for `https://` prefix.
**Learning:** `startsWith("https://")` is insufficient protection against SSRF. Attackers can still access internal HTTPS services or use the server as a proxy to external sites. Redirects can also bypass initial checks.
**Prevention:** Always validate the hostname against a strict allowlist of trusted domains (e.g., Supabase storage). Disable redirects in `fetch` using `{ redirect: "error" }` when possible.
